Written by Zach Girouard

This is a simple land generation program written in Python. The program creates a random birds-eye-view map consisting of water, sand, grass, and snow. Using the time package, the user can see the land being generated in real time. This program was written as part of the CSCE 155A class at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
